# Information on NAICS

"BEA’s industry groupings generally follow the North American Industry Classification System, better known as NAICS codes (pronounced “nakes”). Data are produced for broad sectors such as manufacturing or retail trade, and also for subcategories such as computer and electronic parts manufacturing or food and beverage stores.

What can you do with industry data?
Answer questions like

Which U.S. industries are expanding fastest?

How much of an industry’s growth is due to price inflation? 
Industry statistics are widely used for estimating the effects of various policies, regulations, and tax proposals. The U.S. International Trade Commission uses them to gauge the impact of trade policies. The Patent and Trademark Office uses them to measure copyright-related industries. The detailed statistics from BEA's input-output accounts are the building blocks for our estimates of gross domestic product, and other agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics rely on these data as well."
